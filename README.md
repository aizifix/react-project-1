# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Project 1 - Profile Cards with Dynamic Status
Starting with a mini project with React that allows me to dive deep into the fundamentals of using arrays, maps, and objects within the React.js framework. As I continue to explore and understand the intricacies of React, I look forward to creating and sharing more complex and interactive projects with you all in the near future.
